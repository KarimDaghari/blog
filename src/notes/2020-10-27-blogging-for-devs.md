title: Blogging for devs
excerpt: My key takeaways from this newsletter course I took
---

## Day 1: Where to publish

1. Publish on your own (.com) domain[^1]
2. Publish your content on platforms that allow canonical urls[^2] (e.g., dev.to, medium.com[^3])

## Day 2: What to publish

1. Keep an idea log: Personally I use an excel doc
2. Figure out what is the reader's intent (entertainment, information, to solve a problem, etc...)
3. Do keyword(s) research

## Day 3: Keyword research

1. Do a google search using keywords related to your idea + use an seo (browser) extension to inform you of the traffic related to those keywords
2. Pick which keywords you think are going to let you perform best[^4]
3. Find tail keywords[^5]
4. Use keywords (both main/head and tail) everywhere, strategically[^6]
5. Try to get people to share your content
6. Craft a good title.

## Day 4: The actual content

1. The headline can make or break your post so make sure to come up with multiple version and pick whichever one you think will stick better
2. The shorter the content, the better.
3. Be humaine: i.e., use humor and make it relatable
4. Specific > General
5. End with a call to action

## Day 5: Understand your audience

Nothing really new here: you have to understand your audience.

Addition mine: To do that, first be your own audience (therefore, you have an internal feedback loop) and two, talk to people.

## Day 6: Checklist before publishing

1. Check your canonical tag is all good
2. Make sure your analytics is up correctly (personally, as of this writing, I don't use any analytics solution)
3. Make sure social media metadata is all good
4. Spellcheck and grammar check
5. Review the title, for n^th^ time
6. Ask a friend for feedback
7. Sleep on it

## Day 7: Where to share

- Twitter
- Facebook Groups[^7]
- Reddit[^7]
- HN[^7]
- Syndication platforms (e.g., dev.to)

[^1]: this is not a new thing for me, but I included it because it's _really_ important and yes I am fully aware of the irony.
[^2]: a canonical url tells the search engine which url is the original. To learn more check this post by Moz: <https://moz.com/learn/seo/canonicalization#:~:text=A%20canonical%20tag%20(aka%20%22rel,content%20appearing%20on%20multiple%20URLs>.
[^3]: I don't recommend it. Medium sucks.
[^4]: You don't want keywords that rank really high as that usually means that everyone is targeting for that
[^5]: Basically, those are keywords related to yours; example: Your keywords are "react router", tail keywords then would be something like "react router route".
[^6]: Recommended locations include, but not limited to: meta title and description, subheadings, first sentence (of every paragraph -- addition mine), throughout the paragraphs, etc...
[^7]: Be sure to "make a name for yourself" before you post something you produced as it may backfire
