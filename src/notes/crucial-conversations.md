title: "Crucial Conversation: Talking When Stakes are high"
---

TL;DR: Basically if there’s only two things to get away from this book it would be:

- Learn to look: ask “Are we in dialogue”
- Make it safe: use apology, contrast, priming.

- Contrast: I don’t want to … but what I do want ..
- Priming: (a bit risky) guessing what the problem might come from.

**Crucial Conversations, what are they anyway ?**

Crucial: adj, means important, of the highest order.

Conversations: to converse, to speak with someone.

Crucial conversations are when opinion vary, stakes are high (e.g. a promotion, something about your partner is bothering you) and emotions run strong.

**NOTE: with ≠ to.**

The first involves two parties, the latter involves a speaker and a receiver.

The first in bidirectional, the latter is unidirectional.

**Start With The Heart:**

TL;DR: Me first, us second. Start by stating what YOU want first and then move on into others.

Focus on what you really want. Ask these questions:

What do I really want:

For me?

For others?

For the relationship?

Also ask: How would I behave if I really want this ?

Refuse the fool’s choice, i.e. thinking that there’s only options: either silence or violence.
Ask:
What do I not want?
How should I go about getting what I really want and avoiding what I don’t want?

**Learn To Look:**

TL;DR: See if you’re deviating from the issue.

Look for when conversations become crucial, ask:
Am I going to silence or violence?
Are others?

**Make It Safe:**

TL;DR: When you sense that things aren’t going fluidly (i.e. the other party is being way too silent) do something to make it safe. Don’t worry about it, your instincts will kick in.

Apologize when needed.

Contrast to fix misunderstanding.

Use the CRIB Method to get to mutual purpose:

**C**ommit to seek mutual purpose.

**R**ecognize the purpose behind the strategy.

**I**nvent a mutual purpose (if one is none existent)

**B**rainstorm new strategies.

Ask:
Is safety at risk? Why?
Have I established mutual purpose?
Am I maintaining mutual respect?
What will I do to rebuild safety?

Master My Stories

TL;DR:

1. Facts,
2. Storytelling skills,
3. Ask Others for their opinions,
4. Remind them that it’s a story (i.e. a version, an opinion)

Retrace my path to action

Separate fact from story

Ask:
Why would a reasonable, rational, and decent person do this?
What should I do right now to move toward what I really want?

STATE My Path

Share your facts.
Tell your story.
Ask for others’ paths. i.e. Ask him/her what he/she thinks?
Talk tentatively. I.e. use ‘I think that..’, ‘In my opinion..’, ‘In my POV..’
Encourage testing. I.e. Invite him/her to say what’s on her mind and make it safe to do so.

Ask:
Am I talking about the real issue ?
Am really open to others’ views?

Explore Others’ Paths
Use the AMPP method:
Ask
Mirror
Paraphrase
Prime

Know your ABCs: (same as socrates’ secrets)
Agree
Build
Compare

Move To Action
Actions speak louder than words.

Decide how decisions should be made (i.e. top to bottom, voting, consensus)
Follow up.

Ask:
How will do what and by when.
