Whenever I have a task to do, I'm usually well-equipped to deal with it. I know which mental model I'm going to rely on, the viable tips and tricks to not procrastinate. Yet, sometimes I just don't. I get stuck on the execution part of the process (which is a pretty big deal).

I think I found the reason why. In my experience, it's **expectations**.

I found that the best way to get things done, is settings my expectations straight. As a perfectionist (or at least that's what I believe myself to be), I hate half-assing stuff, when things don't come out the way I want them to -- the way they look in my head. So I figured that in order for me to change my expectations wasn't to "lower" or "be realistic abt" them.

I needed a change of perspective.

Here's an example: Writing. I used to write quite extensively about my findings (whether they were things I knew about or simply things I wanted to know more about) but once I started getting some views (in the ballpark of 100's) and close to no interactions, I started writing less and less, until I just stopped. At first I thought I just got bored or I got burnt out. Nope. After some introspection, turns out it's just a matter of perception: Having close to no interaction pushed me to set the bar higher with every new writing, up to a point where I set the bar so high that I couldn't even _fathom_ to reach, let alone actually do it. And that sucked big time. Writing made me feels good and almost every day I would come up with an idea. I'd start writing a draft and as soon as I do, I'd start questioning myself ("Is this going to be any good? How will it be received? Am I qualified to speak about this? etc...").

So, what did I do about it? At first, nothing. Then, nothing. But then... well, still nothing. And that was no bueno. Until one day, I decided to give myself permission to produce shit. My internal monologue went something like this: "Welp... It's probably going to suck anyway, it's not like I'm going to be the next Shakespeare... So, fuck it. Might as well do it."

## Conclusion

Q. How to _actually_ get stuff done?

A. Give yourself permission to produce shit.
