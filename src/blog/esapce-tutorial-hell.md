## What is tutorial hell

Tutorial hell is a metaphorical place where you keep spiraling in tutorials, without ever actually learning anything[^1] _practical_.

Here's the setup: Say you want to learn a new technology X[^2], so what do you do?

1. Google: You start experimenting with keywords ("tutorials for ...", "resources for ...", "how to learn ...", etc...)
2. You click through all of the links in a horizontal fashion[^3]
3. You read through each link diagonally
4. You start eliminating the resources that aren't a good fit for you
5. You settle on one resource[^4] and start consuming it
6. You get stuck.
7. You restart the process

That my friend is tutorial hell: A never ending loop of looking for the _best_ resource.

**âš  Spoiler alert: It doesn't exist.**

## How to escape it

Before I spill my secrets there's one thing I need to tell you.

The reason why the _best_ resource doesn't exist is pretty simple and it's two folds: (1) Most knowledge is imperfect, (2) people are different so what clicks with you isn't necessarily what clicks with me (for example: I learn better from text than videos because I find the latter to be too slow for me so I lose interest pretty quickly)

And now, with the secret plan:

1. Before you learn the tech, have a project in mind[^5]
2. Pick a resource (use the same process cited above)
3. Change one word in the 5^th^ step for it to become:

> settle on one resource and start **producing**

That's it. It's **that** simple[^6].

[^1]: Not saying you won't learn anything in the absolute sense of the word, but whatever it is you learn, you won't really be able to put it in practice -- you'll be stuck in the theory.
[^2]: You could substitute it with whatever you want: JS/TS, Go, Rust, Python, Scala, Java, etc...
[^3]: I forgot what the right term is but this is basically a technique used in Journalism allowing the journalist to get a panoramic view of the subject.
[^4]: Regardless of what the format might be: text, audio (yes, podcasts are actually instructive) or video.
[^5]: If nothing comes up in mind, pick a product you use on a daily basis (could be Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Spotify, Reddit, etc...) and clone it. The goal isn't to create, but to learn.
[^6]: simple != easy
