## The How

By... drum rolls please... _STARTING_, the end. I'm dead serious.

The post isn't going to write itself you know? So, might as well start with a less-than-perfect version and iterate on it.

It's pretty hard to start with a blank page. I mean, that's the essence of the writer's block[^1]. Your best bet would be to write a (relatively) bad version first and heavily edit it.

Once you get past the initial difficulty of starting to write another question imposes itself. **_What should I write about?_**

### What Should You Write About

Let's get one thing right off the bat, there's no "should"[^2].

The floor is yours. Write about whatever you want! Not an authority on the subject? No problem. The worst that could happen would be one of these two:

1. You get mocked. But, chances are, sooner or later you'll get mocked either way, so might as well do it ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2. You get corrected by an actual authority... How is this a bad thing?

That being said, I still haven't answer the question. Will do in a minute, as there's a subtler, more urgent question that needs to be addressed.

#### Who Are You Writing It For

If your answer is others, that would be the wrong one. Here's why:

1. **"Others"** is too broad. You want to narrow down your audience as much as possible in order to communicate in the most effective way possible.

2. **Too abstract**. Our brain can't make sense of things in aggregate. The bigger their number, the more energy it has to dispense to make sense of them. I don't know about you, I'd like to focus solely on one thing: the content.

It's obvious then that you should be writing for yourself. But then, again, why? The answer to this question is a direct derivate of the answer of the original question (that is: **What should you write about?**).

**Answering the original question**: I've found that viewing writing as a _documentation process_[^3] is the most effective way to actually write stuff.

First, you'll easily find what to write about (unless you're a tree, but even then, trees are actually pretty amazing... Did you know that they had memories? And they last for at least 100 years? -- read that in an article a while ago).

Second, since you're documenting things, you're writing them for your future self.

Third, since you are the audience, then you'll know how (or at least, should know how) to address yourself in the most effective/efficient way possible. Plus, you get to set your own concrete expectations.

As not to be too handwavy about it, here's an actual example: I wanted to go back to blogging, so I decided to write about it. EVERYTHING written here is the thought process I used to write this. And guess what? I started with a blank page but what happened next will shock you! I tricked myself. To stay committed, I needed to be held accountable so I published a screenshot as excerpt on social media. Less than an hour later, over 500 words written. BOOM.

So yeah, to circle back, if you want to start blogging, writing, or anything for that matter, then just... Start.

[^1]: If I were to err on the side of preciseness though, that's only true to an extent.
[^2]: Unless it's your job, then I'm not the best authority to tell you how to do your job.
[^3]: To give credit where it's due, this is mostly influenced by Gary Vaynerchuk's view: 'Document, don't create' (one of the few things I agree with)
