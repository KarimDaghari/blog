title: Lessons I learned from failing a startup
excerpt: I've been thinking long and hard about this one.

_My use of the term **startup** is pretty loose here. I mean by it: a product that could become a business._

## The product in question

![Eggnite Logo](https://eggnite.xyz/Logo.png)

**Eggnite**. The name is a mix between "Egg" and "Ignite", the reasoning behind it was that it would be **the** launching platform for ideas.

The vision behind it was that it would help foster an African community of indie makers -- it's already hard as it is, a community is something we deeply need. But truth is, it doesn't matter how noble the vision is.

## Lessons

### Building a product and building a business are two distinct things

If you get one takeaway, let this be it. First of all, building a product and building a business require two different skill sets.

**Building a product** requires the following skills[^1]: architecture and coding (although with the advent of no-code tools it seems less of an issue), design and most importantly **empathy**.

> Q: What ? What has got empathy to do with anything?
>
> A: How are you going to build a product that resonates with your audience? Tell me how, and I'll find a way to link it back to empathy

**Building a business** requires the following skills[^1]: marketing, forecasting and sales. And if like me you have natural tendencies towards technical subjects, you probably suck big time at either of those three. I'm not saying you can't learn them, just that they don't come naturally. Which is completely normal, since I found that these two aspects (product and business) require different mindsets.

### The tech stack _does_ matter

I'm going against the grain here. Most traditional advice, the one I ingurgitated, states the contrary. From my own experience, the tech stack matters big time especially when you're the one building the product. There's no right or best tech stack in the absolute sense of the term. But there _is_ a right tech stack for _you_ because that's the one you're most productive in. That's the one that'll get you shipping fast*er* and higher quality code. Even if it's spaghetti code, at least you understand what you're actually doing with your code[^2].

### Build the MVP first

~~An MVP is basically the simplest version of the product you can get away with.~~

~~An MVP is basically the leanest version of the product you can get away with.~~

An MVP is basically the most bare bone version of the product that addresses the problem you're attempting to solve and one you can get away with. There, this is better.

In my case, it would be a newsletter. But I built a whole platform. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Truth is, when you have an idea you're building it on top of some hypothesis of yours. Thing is, you're _almost_ never certain of its correctness so the MVP will give you the feedback you're looking for: Either it's correct, it's not or it needs some course correction[^3].

If anything, the actual value of MVP is it saves you time. If you don't care about that, then please give me some of the extra time you have! I'm afraid 24 hours in a day can't cut it for me.

### Sell it before you make it

Whether you're actually building a paid service/product or a free one, it usually have some unit of sale. Maybe it's measured in terms of monetary value or email addresses or intentions of purchase. Whatever the unit of sale might be, that's the metric you'll use to gauge _actual_ interest.

**How much to sell it for?**

Whatever arbitrary value you have in mind, it's too low. You might think _but that's too expensive!_, and it might be true (I don't know about your particular case). However what I do know is that the type of clients you'll get is going to be a real PITA.

In my case it was to collect 10 email addresses. Too low. Should've been in the ballpark of 100's.

**Who to sell it to?**

Are you asking me about **your** target audience? If that's the case, I don't know.

What I can answer however is: **Who _not_ to sell it to**. F.F.

Do not sell it to your **friends** and **family**. Unless you want to inflate your ego, in that case, by all means.

### But first, build an audience

This. It was a hard lesson. It doesn't matter how noble your mission is. It doesn't matter how technically advanced your solution might be. Nothing matters if you don't have a platform to share it with. Having an audience = unfair advantage. Having an audience means you get quasi-instantaneous users for your product just because **you** built it. Because having an audience means having people who actually trust you. And here's one secret of the biz world: it's all about trust. Everything boils down to trust. Otherwise why would you believe a single word of what I said?

**So, how do you build an audience?** I admit that I have a few ideas, but they're too crude to expose right now. I'll share them when they're fully baked!
